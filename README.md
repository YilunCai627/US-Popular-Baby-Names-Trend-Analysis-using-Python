# US-Popular-Baby-Names-Trend-Analysis-using-Python
## Background
 Whether you want to make sure your baby is on trend, or you're trying to avoid anything too popular, government baby name lists provide parents with a ton of naming information and inspiration.  

In this study, we'll work with open data on [Popular Baby Names](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) made by the United States Social Security Administration (SSA). 

## Data Analytics Outline
### **1. Research Questions**
Choosing a name for a baby is a big commitment. Cultural diversity in the U.S. has led to great variations in names and naming traditions and names have been used to express creativity, personality, cultural identity, and values.  

Do you want to go with an all-time classic name, or something trendy and of-the-moment? Do you want a popular name, or do you want to find something that's truly unique (but not so unique that it's illegal)? And, if it's the latter, how do you know that your unique name isn't one that's going to top all of the baby lists in the next five years? It's time to do some research.

### **2. Data Questions**  
the US Social Security Administration makes available data files, one per year, containing the total number of births for each sex/name combination. [The raw archive (“National data” file)](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) can be obtained from the website of US Social Security Administration.

There are many things we can explore with the dataset:
* Analyze the total births by year of birth and sex
* Visualize the naming trend given a particular name over time
* Determine the relative popularity of names in each year
* Sort the names for male and female babies by decade or state
### **3. Data Answers**  
#### Total Number of US births by sex and year
The graph below shows the number of applicants for a Social Security card by year of birth and sex.

#### Analyzing Naming Trends
Because the data include information spanning from 1880 to the present, we can examine trends in time of baby names for any changes and visualize the trend.

Looking at the naming trend over these year, you might conclude that some old-fashioned names have grown out of favor with the American population. But the story is actually more complicated than that, as will be explored in the future analysis.

### **4. Research Answers**
US Social Security applications are a great way to track trends in how babies born in the US are named.  
We can observe the birth trends rise and fall based on economic trends- they births tend to fall in times of recession, and male births started to outpace female births after World War two.

TV shows, the Royal Family, and a tendency to choose shorter names are a few of the trends that are influencing the names that are climbing the charts. In fact, Emma are the current chart-topping baby names for girls according to the SSA. This result exactly match the increasing naming trend of Emma over recent years as our visualization indicates.
